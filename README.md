# rawtherapee

Bash scripts I use in my RawTherapee workflow. Although "workflow" is probably a bit far-fetched here. Let's call it "usecases" like copying files around my photo directories, adding metadata, archiving after postprocessing, etc.

If anybody wants to use these scripts for their own purposes, please be advised that these work fine in my environment but I won't give any guarantees that they'll run everywhere. Everything is pretty much tied to my directory layout and similar constraints. And I wouldn't vouch for an absence of bugs so handle with care.
